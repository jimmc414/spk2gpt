# spk2gpt
This program is a text proofreading and punctuation fixing tool that uses OpenAI's ChatGPT API. The user is prompted to speak their input, which is then converted to text and sent to the API. The API processes the input and returns a response, which is then copied to the clipboard. The program plays a sound to indicate success.
